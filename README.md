# Clustered Federated Learning to Support Context-dependent CSI Decoding

Heasung Kim, The University of Texas at Austin

This repository contains the implementation of "Clustered Federated Learning to support Context-dependent CSI Decoding".


## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Access
The **CSI dataset** used in our **federated learning** experiments is publicly available at the Texas Data Repository:

ðŸ”— https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/AFEKXT

The dataset consists of eight heterogeneous local CSI datasets, each split into training and test sets.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
To get started quickly, please refer to:  `main_notebook.ipynb`

This notebook provides a detailed explanation of the dataset, runs the proposed algorithm, and visualizes the results.






### Note 

It extends the work presented in:

>Kim, Heasung, Hyeji Kim, and Gustavo de Veciana.
Clustered Federated Learning via Gradient-Based Partitioning,
ICML 2024 â€“ Forty-first International Conference on Machine Learning.

This codebase introduces additional components specifically designed for wireless CSI compression and feedback, including dataloaders, custom datasets, and tools for analyzing context-dependent decoder behavior in federated settings.
